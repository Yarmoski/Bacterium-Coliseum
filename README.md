# Bacterium-Coliseum
A C++ OOP game harkening back to classic arcade shooters. Defend yourself from hordes of bacteria while building your score and utilizing abilites.

# How to Play
Extract the Bacterium-Coliseum-Game-Pack.zip file to a directory and simply run the exe! 

Use the left and right arrow keys (for some machines, you may use the A and D keys to move left and right respectively) to move your character around the arena. Use space to fire your primary weapon and enter to fire your limited, but powerful secondary weapon. Staus info can be found on the top bar when playing the game. Each time to clear a level of enemies, the next level will begin and will be more difficult than the last. Keep an eye out for powerups along your movement path, but beware the poison fungus that can spawn in place of a powerup and damage you upon contact.

# Roadmap
- update art
- add grenade launcher
- add new art for semi aggressive enemy
