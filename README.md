# Bacterium-Coliseum (Kontagion)
A C++ OOP game harkening back to classic arcade shooters. Play as the minature scientist-turned-super-soldier Socrates and defend yourself from hordes of bacteria while building your score and utilizing abilites.

# Quick Start
Download or clone the repo and simply run the .exe file!

Use the left and right arrow keys (for some machines, you may use the A and D keys to move left and right respectively) to move your character around the arena. Use space to fire your primary weapon and enter to fire your powerful secondary weapon. 

Status info can be found on the top bar when playing the game. Each time to clear a level of enemies, the next level will begin and will be more difficult than the last. Keep an eye out for powerups along your movement path, but beware the poison fungus that can spawn in place of a powerup and damage you upon contact.

# Roadmap
- ~~lower default difficulty~~
- add difficulty settings
- add grenade launcher
- add new modes (zen, arcade)
- add bosses with projectile attacks
